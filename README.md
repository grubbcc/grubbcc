### Hello World
Hi, I'm a freelance web developer with full-stack experience seeks to put his extensive technical and scientific knowledge to use as a creative problem solver. Lately I've been spending a lot of energy working on my [Anagrams](anagrams.site) application. You can also find much of my teaching notes and related materials at [my homepage](seattlephysicstutor.com). The website is currently a bit of a mess, but I have plans to update it with all kinds of new interactive content, including some pretty neat genealogy visualizations, as soon is a get a chance. Java is the language I've used the most, but I've also taught introductory programming at the high school level in C++ and Python. I have also dabbled in JavaScript (especially D3.js), SQL, Docker, AWS, and a variety of other tools.
